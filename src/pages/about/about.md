# About

Supermeowkat is an online art gallery I invented in the last days of 2019. Iâ€™ve wanted this as my DJ name for roughly 5 years now, but, never got round to learning music properly. Since I'm a lot closer to the new media art world than to music, it's now a new media art thing!

Supermeowkat wants to explore how much we can do with this exhibition format. What happens if people send in a Jupyter notebook of statistics art? What if it's a set of JavaScript functions? What if it's a live performance art piece from a farm? We think there's a lot to explore here, if people even send in anything. Most of it won't be of interest to the casual viewer. But to curators and tech folks, it might be something.

Yeah, Supermeowkat is just [Alex](https://github.com/alexalexyang) right now, despite salting these paragraphs with the pronoun "We". Maybe there'll be more folks in future. Who knows, maybe it'll transform into a citizen data science thing one day. The future is an enigma wrapped in a Schrodinger's sandwich shrouded by equal parts dream and hellfire. Nobody knows anything about it.

Supermeowkat does not claim to be anything like professional. I'm just winging it. Heck, I banged out the call for artworks in one day and coded this site in a little under three with almost no peer reviews or testing.

Nonetheless, send in your artworks if you like what you read in the Call for Artworks. We're excited to see what shows up, if any at all.
